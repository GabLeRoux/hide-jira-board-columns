# Hide Jira board columns

Simple chrome extension to hide some columns from your Jira board.

![Jira example](/doc/jira-example.png)

## Installation

Until this is deployed to the Chrome Web Store, you can do this:

1. Download latest zip file in [the releases tab](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/hide-jira-board-columns/releases).
2. Unzip the the file
3. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
4. Drag n drop the folder of the plugin

Have fun! :v:

## Development

I used [yeoman/generator-chrome-extension](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension) to generate this extension so refer to it for build commands and more.

## Todo / nice to have

- [x] Button to hide columns
- [x] Icon!
- [ ] Have the hide button display again when we select a different quick filter
- [ ] :warning: Find a way not to mess the drag-n-drop system ;)
- [ ] Toggle buttons instead (hide/show), maybe use `aui-iconfont-arrows-left` and `aui-iconfont-arrows-right` from [Atlassian icons](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/5.5.1/docs/icons.html)
- [ ] Persistent settings (remember hidden columns)
- [ ] Publish extension

# Hide Jira board columns

Simple chrome extension to hide some columns from your jira board.

![Jira example](/doc/jira-example.png)

I used [yeoman/generator-chrome-extension](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension) to generate this extension so refer to it for build commands and more.

## Todo / nice to have

- [x] Button to hide columns
- [ ] Have the hide button show again when we choose a diferent quick filter
- [ ] Toggle buttons instead (hide/show)
- [ ] Persistent settings (remember hidden columns)
- [ ] Publish extension

Pull requests welcome! :v:
